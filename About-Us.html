      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <h4>Background</h4>
      <p>Since your establishment in April 2013 we have actively positioned ourselves to become a leading conveyance and commercial law practice in the broader Kuils River area. The firm has earned acceptance and respect across a wide spectrum of clients, from the independent entrepreneur to parastatal and multinational corporations. The quality of our service and strong client relationships have differentiated it from other law firms and has developed strategic alliances, both nationally and internationally.</p>

      <h4>Office Infrastructure</h4>
      <p>Our internal capacity allows us to deal with a high volume of legal and technical work. We have access to national skills, resources and a wealth of knowledge through association with various other firms which complements our special services. We work in association with Meyer Nel Attorneys and McClutsky Le Roux Attorneys in Bellville.</p>
      <p>Fundamental to the success of the firm are the principles of honesty, integrity and the pursuit of service excellence. We provide a high-tech legal service and are electronically linked to Korbitec (Ghost Convey), Lawyers Access Web, Search Works, Web Convey, Attorney Gate Way, Windeed, Do Comply and Stordoc. </p>

      <h4>Our Vision</h4>
      <p>The firm is a predominantly commercially oriented law firm, which provides highly personalized services to our clients. Our professional policy of acquainting ourselves, to the way our clients do business and the challenges facing them, allows the firm to provide quality solutions in a pro-active manner. Our vision is to become a leading commercial law firm in the Northern Suburbs, of the Western Cape, providing an excellent and sustainable service to all our clients and adding value to our stakeholders.</p>

      <h4>Our Objectives</h4>
      <p>We aim to form long term relationships with all of our clients, providing quality legal services at affordable tariffs and always aiming to keep our clients happy! As the sole member of 62 on Long CC, trading as Salprop Estate Agency, Fatima Salie is actively involved in property developments of her own and as well as on behalf of clients. This ensures that we are able to offer our clients comprehensive and appropriate solutions across a wide spectrum of services.</p>
      <p>Our motivated staff prides themselves on accurate and high quality performance, achieving the top performing attorney on ABSA Bank's Top Performing Attorney list in November 2011.</p>
